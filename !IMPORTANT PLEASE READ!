<!-- 

I'm writing these notes as many of the website projects I had produced
did not have user accessiblity in mind as the priority of the design. My hope is that 
these notes will clarify the navigation/functionality of some of the projects
when looking through them.



1) For the Museum Object Project (The website with the black backgrond and abstract shapes) 
click on the red triangle shapes to proceed to the next web page 

2) For the Paul Ford project, the user is able to draw/scribble in the background
at the top of the web page. Simply click down with your mouse to start drawing

3) For my reading response to Louise Drulheâ€™s essay, the text orientation and layout
of the website change based on the width of the user's browser window. By rescaling its size
the layout and its colors will change with it
