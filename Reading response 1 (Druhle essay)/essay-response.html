    <div id="div1">Druhle's propositions were interesting to read about. What surprised 
        me most when reading was how the United States has almost unlimited power 
        across the web. I used to think that the web was controlled by multiple sources 
        in different countries, but Druhle's essay points out that the majority 
        of the web is really hosted by American corporations. As a result the bulk 
        of internet content is created and consumed by America. This is another facet 
        of globalization. The spreading of American culture is inherent in its capture 
        of internet culture. Another point Druhle brought up was the fluidity of contemporary 
        reading. We are no longer confined to a singular page, and a singular layout.

        The web has opened up the opportunity to expand how we read. Reading left to right 
        is now an option. There are now no prerequisites for how one should read or how one 
        should design for a viewer's reading experience. I remember reading an article that
        attempted to summarize the differences between reading in print and reading digitally. 
        The consensus made was that digital readers skimmed content unanimously. While print 
        readers were engaged longer in the text they were consuming. This left a notable 
        impression on me as I realized that I never really "sit down" to read digitally. I 
        scroll endlessly through articles only to lose hours of precious sleep. For me, this 
        is connected to Druhle's essay. In their essay, Druhle notes that readership often 
        migrates to specific points on the internet. Reddit is one example. As a forum, Reddit 
        occupies a unique space on the web. Reddit endlessly creates subcultures by which viewers 
        can participate in. As a result the forum site is able to connect individuals on a mass 
        scale unseen of before. Other social media sites have a similar effect on their audience.
